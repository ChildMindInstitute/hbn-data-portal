<h1>Recruitment<a class="headerlink" href="#recruitment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A primary goal for the Healthy Brain Network is to generate a dataset that captures the broad range of heterogeneity and impairment that exists in developmental psychopathology. Accordingly, the marketing team adopted a community-referred recruitment model using advertisements to encourage participation of families who have concerns about psychiatric symptoms in their child.  The advertisements were distributed to community members, educators and local care providers, as well as directly to parents via e-mail lists and events. The advertisements highlight the potential value of participation for children who may require school-based accommodations. In particular, the Healthy Brain Network provided the comprehensive diagnostic evaluation reports, which include clinical impressions and actionable treatment recommendations; when appropriate, the reports can be used to acquire an Individualized Education Program (IEP) - a prerequisite for obtaining school accommodations and services, as well as specialized classroom placements. Up to three feedback sessions and referral information are provided to participants and their families as well, along with modest monetary compensation for their time and expenses incurred.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this recruitment strategy was developed to achieve the major goals of the Healthy Brain Network after considering the relative merits of the adopted strategy versus a fully representative epidemiologic design. The primary goal of the Healthy Brain Network is to generate a large-scale, transdiagnostic sample for biomarker discovery and investigations of the neural substrates associated with commonly occurring illness phenotypes. While ascertainment is not clinic-based, per se, the strategy of recruiting on the basis of perceived clinical concern dictates that the Healthy Brain Network sample will include a high proportion of individuals affected by psychiatric illness. Nonetheless, despite the lack of rigorous epidemiologic ascertainment, the intended scale of data collection and the inclusion of diverse communities across New York City may approximate representativeness in the sample.  The scale of the sample should also allow investigators to study selected sub-cohorts of interest for targeted study (e.g., comparing individuals with ADHD residing in Midtown Manhattan vs. those residing in Staten Island). Finally, depending on the ability to secure financial support, the fourth phase of the Healthy Brain Network will switch strategies to make the final 1500 participants a representative epidemiologic cohort.</p>

<h2>Community Advertisements<a class="headerlink" href="#community-advertising" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because the Healthy Brain Network is a community-based research study, health and community fairs figure prominently among its recruitment strategies.  The Healthy Brain Network also runs advertising campaigns, both digital and print, publishes some billboard advertising, and engages in social media campaigns.  Below are samples of efforts within each of those areas.</p>

<div style="transform:translateY()">
<p style="margin-top:0px;">The Healthy Brain Network participates in health and community fairs throughout the targeted recruitment area.  Typically, an outreach team distributes <a class="reference internal" href="_files/_recruit/ParticipantFlyers.pdf" target="-blank">flyers</a> (PDF) to attendees and answers questions. Some of these events prove even more useful for establishing partnerships with government or community organizations than they are for connecting with families who may be interested in participating.  For some events, our outreach team includes clinicians, and even celebrity spokesmen such as Brandon and Michi Marshall.  When the mobile research vehicle (MRV) is present, staff sometimes follow a mental health screener mini-protocol by administering the <a class = "reference internal" href = "assessments/sdq.html" >Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</a> to children aged 5-21.</p>

<h3>Print Advertising<a class="headerlink" href="#print-advertising" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Healthy Brain Network's print advertising efforts have taken place in the Staten Island area, where one of its flagship offices is located.  The multi-platform publication <a class="reference external" href="http://www.siparent.com/">Staten Island Parent</a> is the primary venue for these efforts. The Healthy Brain Network marketing team also placed print advertisements in monthly parent magazines in other markets, and annual resource guides aimed at parent audiences.  Advertisements are timed to coincide with both the school calendar and historical dips in inquiries, or the opening of a new location. In addition, the Healthy Brain Network has also posted billboard advertisements on the Staten Island Ferry. Below are advertisements included in the Staten Island Parent and New Jersey Family print publications during campaigns in 2017.</p>

<h3>Digital Marketing<a class="headerlink" href="#digital-marketing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Healthy Brain Network's primary digital marketing effort is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.healthybrainnetwork.org/" target="-blank">Healthy Brain Network recruitment website</a>.  The site has a simple design with basic information on study goals, the organization and research team, and participating in the study.  The website houses two videos – one where visitors can view a message from HBN spokesperson Brandon Marshall, and a second one where they can learn how one family benefited from participation in the study.  Families or individuals with questions or interest in participating in the study can submit an inquiry from any page on the site.  All other outreach efforts, digital (detailed below) and otherwise, point toward the Healthy Brain Network website in some capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Email Efforts</strong></p>
<p>The Healthy Brain Network has used email campaigns on several occasions. One flyer (right) was used in a direct email campaign to Staten Island Parent subscribers in the winter and early spring of 2016.  Following the opening of the Healthy Brain Network office in Midtown Manhattan, an email announcement was sent via the Child Mind Institute campaign program to a list of individuals who had previously contacted the Child Mind Institute about participating in research.  The marketing team also ran a short announcement in New York City Council Member Corey Johnson’s West Side Newsletter as a means of promoting the opening of the Manhattan location.  In the summer of 2016 the team placed a small advertisement in the Staten Island Parent weekly newsletter for several weeks in an attempt to counter the summer dip in enrollment.  The team also reaches out to school guidance counselors and psychologists, and community organization contacts, both individually and via campaigns, as a part of partnering efforts.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Website Adverts</strong></p>
<p>The marketing team posted a video detailing one family’s experiences with the Healthy Brain Network on SIParent.com.  The video opened via an advert on the Staten Island Parent homepage.  In addition to this paid piece, the team also posted a free listing in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.siparent.com/family-children-services/" target="-blank">resource section of SIParent.com</a>.  The team also secured a website posting from summer 2016 through summer 2017 for Big Apple Parents Annual Resource Guide.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
<p>The Healthy Brain Network engaged in social media marketing via the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation’s social media channels in conjunction with the Atlantic Antic 2016.  These efforts included posts to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (pictured to the left), featuring either the Healthy Brain Network spokesperson video or the HBN testimonial video on our website and were aimed at driving both virtual traffic to our website prior to the event, and foot traffic to the MRV at the event.</p>
<p>In addition to social posts surrounding specific events such as Atlantic Antic, the marketing team also makes use of Child Mind Institute social channels to post news and events related to the Healthy Brain Network.</p>
<p><strong>Community Lists</strong></p>
<p>The marketing team regularly posts to the volunteer section of Craigslist and makes an effort to secure listings on community resource lists such as those on HITE site.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="partnerships">
<h2>Partnerships<a class="headerlink" href="#partnerships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Healthy Brain Network also relies on partnerships to refer participating families for evaluation.  These partnerships include schools, pediatricians, psychiatrists, educators and community service organizations sending families to the Healthy Brain Network.</p>
<p>Frequently, these partners connect with the Healthy Brain Network at health fairs and community events focused on mental health. In some cases, the Healthy Brain Network reaches out to partners directly by making drop-in visits to potential partners and leaving a partnering <a class="reference internal" href="_files/_recruit/HBNReferrer_Flyer_5-20-16.docx" target="-blank">flyer</a> (.docx download) along with other recruitment materials they can distribute to interested families. Some partners put flyers for the Healthy Brain Network in their lobby, while others target specific families they think could benefit from participation and approach them directly.  The Healthy Brain Network also sends direct emails and makes direct phone calls to organizations who meet certain criteria.  These criteria include having existing treatments or services focused on mental health, but not necessarily having capacity to provide the comprehensive evaluations offered by the Healthy Brain Network. There is also the option of running email campaigns to potential partners.</p>
<p>During the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aacap.org/annualmeeting/2016" target="-blank">2016 AACAP conference in New York City</a>, the Child Mind Institute hosted an exhibitor booth at the conference.  HBN was also represented there in an attempt to establish relationships with potential partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="branding">
<h2>Branding<a class="headerlink" href="#branding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Community building is a big part of the Healthy Brain Network's outreach.  Relationships with local government offices play a key role in connecting us to the community.  The support of both State Senator Andrew Lanza and Staten Island Borough President James Oddo has been integral to the Healthy Brain Network's success in Staten Island.  To aid the above recruitment efforts, the Healthy Brain Network also engages in the following activities as a means of developing brand awareness and community building:</p>
<li>securing a high profile sports figure as a spokesperson</li>
<li>conducting workshops at partner organizations</li>
<li>partnering with local government officials</li>
<li>speaking at events at locations such as Borough Hall</li>
<li>working with the Staten Island Borough President’s office to implement a short mental health screener at pediatricians’ offices in Staten Island</li>
<li>docking the MRV outside partner organizations or at partner events to conduct short mental health screeners via a mini-protocol</li>

<h3>In the Media<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-media" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Healthy Brain Network recruitment has also benefitted from media attention in a variety of forms. For example, news channel <a class = "reference external" href = "http://www.ny1.com/nyc/staten-island/news/2015/01/21/child-mind-institute-launches-healthy-brain-network-to-improve-mental-health.html" target="_blank">NY1 covered the Healthy Brain Network launch</a> on Staten Island, and the Staten Island Advance wrote several stories <a class = "reference external" href = "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/mental_health_study_to_begin_o.html" target= "_blank">announcing the impending launch and welcoming the arrival of the study</a> when its flagship clinical office first opened in the borough. The same publication also <a class = "reference external" href = "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/01/bp_james_oddo_welcomes_free_ps.html" target= "_blank">ran an op-ed written by Dr. Michael Milham</a> on the topic of youth mental health and suicide in Staten Island.
