xxx_vis_learn = Sequence Learning Paradigm

Triggers are as following:
91 = Start of the Sequence Learning Paradigm
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 = DOT ON (12 and 17 are twice as often, because those stimuli appear twice within each block)
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 = DOT OFF (22 and 27 are twice as often, because those stimuli appear twice within each block)
31, 32, 33, 34, 35 = new block


numtargets:number of targets
sequence:sequence of the positions
CD_Dot_ON:marker for target on position (11 = first stimulus; 12 = second stimulus, ....)
CD_Dot_OFF:marker for target off position (21 = first stimulus; 22 = second stimulus, ....)
numrepet:number of repetitions
resp_click_Trial1:button response of subjects for each block (associated with par.sequence)
resp_click_Trial2:button response of subjects for each block (associated with par.sequence)
resp_click_Trial3:button response of subjects for each block (associated with par.sequence)
resp_click_Trial4:button response of subjects for each block (associated with par.sequence)
resp_click_Trial5:button response of subjects for each block (associated with par.sequence)
CD_START:marker for start of the paradigm
TRIAL:marker for start of each block
numtargets:number of targets
CD_END:marker end of paradigm
useEL:eye-tracker was recorded if 1
useEL_Calib:eye-tracker calibration was performed if 1
recordEEG:EEG was recorded if 1
