<h1>Phenotypic Data Access<a class="headerlink" href="#hbn-phenotypic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Phenotypic data may be accessed through the <a class = "reference external" href = "http://coins.mrn.org/dx">COllaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite (COINS) Data Exchange</a> or an HBN-dedicated instance of the <a class = "reference external" href = "http://data.healthybrainnetwork.org/">Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS)</a>. Prior to entering clinical data into these data sharing tools, all personal identifiers defined as Protected Health Information (PHI) by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are removed. Consistent with standard FCP/INDI protocols, users receive meta-data as comma-separated files (.csv) which does not contain any participant PHI. For each participant, a unique random identifier is used to label all data. </p>
<div class="section" id="participant-identifiers">
<h2>Participant Identifiers<a class="headerlink" href="#participant-identifier" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before entry into the HBN Biobank, all data are de-identified. Specifically, this process requires the removal of any and all personal identifiers specified by the Health Information in Accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). During the consent process, all participants provide informed consent for their data to be openly shared following this de-identification process. Data sharing occurs through the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project and its International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (FCP/INDI)(Mennes et al. 2013).</p>
<p><em>Electronic Data.</em> Electronic data is collected via <a class = "reference external" href = "http://www.nextgen.com/" target="_blank">NextGen</a>. NextGen provides the infrastructure for both the collection of applicable phenotypic assessments and the participant portal. All data collected electronically is stricken of any participant protected health information (PHI). Participants are given a random unique identifier, generated directly from the electronic data capture system or the Global Unique Identified (GUID) Tool at the start of participation. The GUID Tool is a customized software application that generates a Global Unique Identifier for each study participant. The GUID is made up of random alpha-numeric characters and is NOT generated from PHI. As such, it has been approved by the NIH Office of General Counsel. All data are labeled with this unique identifier. Applicable participants receive a unique login and password to enter on the Healthy Brain Networks participant portal that serves as a secure, HIPAA-compliant, easy way for participants, and parents of participants, to complete relevant study measures assessments that are not collected during the face-to-face session. The Participant Portal is equipped with a variety of security features, including 128-bit encryption, firewall, anti-virus software, and intrusion detection software. Messaging features are also secure. All electronic data collected as part of the HBN initiative is kept on password- protected computers. Only approved researchers will be granted with logins for electronic data entry, review, and processing.</p>
<p><em>Paper Records.</em> Paper records, including consent, assent, and HIPAA forms, and paper-CRFs are kept in participant files in locked file cabinets. These materials are additional kept behind locked doors. Participant data collected via paper-CRFs will not contain any participant PHI. These data forms will be de-identified and contain only the participant’s unique identifier. Additionally, data collected via paper are inputted into the electronic data system. Therefore all participant data are contained within a single, secure, electronic system to facilitate data sharing efforts of the project.</p>
<p><em>Participant Privacy.</em> Confidentiality was a paramount consideration in planning data-sharing requirements. Protecting participant privacy while also providing access to extensively revealing data was a goal. All imaging data are fully anonymized in compliance with HIPAA by removing any potential protected health information identifiers, including identifying facial features from anatomical images, and randomizing the timing of release. It is important to note that data users must be aware of the possible negative impact of defacing on some analysis toolkits (e.g., FreeSurfer), and exercise additional care when producing such images and/or sharing pre-processed surfaces.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-usage-agreement">
<h2>Data Usage Agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#data-usage-agreement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given these considerations, the HBN Dataset is requiring a data usage agreement for access to the data in the same manner as the <a class = "reference external" href = "http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/">NKI Rockland Sample</a>. The adoption of a data usage agreement is not intended to limit the specific analyses a researcher can perform; users will only need to specify the broad range of analyses they may pursue with the data (e.g., association studies between DTI, R-fMRI, and behavior), not a specific analysis or set of analyses. The intent of the agreement is to ensure that data users agree to protect participant confidentiality when handling data that contains potentially identifying information and that they will agree to take the necessary measures to prevent breaches of privacy. The specific agreement to be employed for the HBN Dataset are those previously defined by the New York State Office of Mental Health, and can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="./_files/CMI_Biobank_DUA.pdf">Data Usage Agreement (DUA)</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the NDAR agreement, institutional review board (IRB) approval is not required for transfer of the data; it will be up to the individual data user to satisfy any additional requirements specified by their local IRB or ethics committee, prior to using the HBN Dataset. Given that local IRB approval is not required as part of an individuals application for access to the HBN Dataset, there is no need for an individual’s IRB to have a federal-wise assurance number – which can limit recipients of the NDAR datasets.</p>

<h2>COINS Data Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#coins-data-exchange" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Protected behavioral and cognitive assessment data are available on the COllaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite (COINS). The Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22275896">COINS; Scott et al., 2011</a>), developed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mrn.org/">Mind Research Network</a>, was created to facilitate communication and cultivate a data-sharing community by providing researchers with an open source information system that includes web-based tools to manage studies, subjects, imaging, and phenotypic data. This suite of tools has an intuitive ease of use and offers versatile data upload/import/entry options, rapid and secure sharing of data among investigators, querying of data types and assessments, real-time reporting, and study-management tools. Among its many features, the web-based assessments, automated data scoring, and integrated management of phenotypic and imaging data are potentially the most attractive. Web-based assessment entry completed by participants and research staff increases efficiency and accuracy by eliminating the need for intermediate data entry (i.e., paper to computer). Equally important, individual item-level responses are coded in the database, providing researchers with a far richer phenotypic dataset for exploration. In addition, protected health information can be unlinked within COINS to facilitate data sharing while maximally protecting participant anonymity. Of note, COINS is in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards and implementation rules.</p>
<p>To access the data, go to: <a href="http://coins.mrn.org/dataexchange">http://coins.mrn.org/dataexchange</a></p>
